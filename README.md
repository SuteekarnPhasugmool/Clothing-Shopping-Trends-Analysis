- Average Purchase Amount: $59.76
- Number of Customers: 3,900  
- The overall revenue and average purchase amount indicate a steady stream of income, with a moderately high customer base.

2. Revenue Breakdown by Categories
- Top Category: Clothing ($104,264), contributing nearly half of the total revenue.
- Accessories: $74,200, the second highest revenue generator.
- Least Revenue: Outerwear ($18,524).
- Insight: Clothing and accessories dominate sales, indicating that marketing efforts should focus on these categories. Thereâ€™s potential to boost sales in footwear and outerwear with targeted promotions.

- Lowest Spending Age Groups: Under 15 ($29,258) and 65-74 ($25,494).
- Insight: Young adults and middle-aged customers are the primary contributors to revenue. Marketing strategies should focus on these demographics, while engagement campaigns could increase spending among older age groups.

- Least Revenue: Weekly shoppers ($31,786).
- Insight: Less frequent but higher-value purchases generate more revenue. This suggests that seasonal promotions and limited-time offers could drive larger purchases.

5. Top 5 Best-Selling Items
- By Revenue: Blouse ($10,410), Shirt ($10,332), and Dress ($10,320).
- By Unit Sales: Blouse (171 units), Pants (171 units), and Jewelry (171 units).
- Insight: Blouses are the top-selling item in both revenue and units, indicating strong demand. However, Jewelry sells well in units but contributes less revenue, suggesting opportunities for premium-priced jewelry collections.

6. Seasonal Revenue Trends
- Highest Season: Fall ($60,018), followed by Winter ($58,607) and Spring ($58,679).
- Lowest Season: Summer ($55,777).
- Insight: Fall and Winter drive the most revenue, likely due to seasonal clothing needs. Summer sales are the lowest, suggesting the need for summer-specific promotions to boost sales.

7. Promo Code and Subscription Impact
- Promo Codes Used: 43% of customers used promo codes.
- Subscriptions: Only 27% of customers have subscriptions.
- Insight: A high percentage of customers use promo codes, highlighting the importance of discount strategies. Increasing subscription rates could drive long-term customer loyalty and recurring revenue.
